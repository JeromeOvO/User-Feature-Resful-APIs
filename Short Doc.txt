Design decisions:
1. used local storage to make it easier to setting up database.
2. apllied express framework so that I can handle http request and design restful apis.
3. implemeted the hash function of bcryptjs to encrypt passwords, and also
    add salt value to make sure the same passwords of different users will have different
    encrypted passwords which make sure the security.
4. applied async and await to make sure the program getting the data it needs.
5. used try and catch function to handle errors.

Challenges I have encountered during development process:
1. when I debug the program, I need to reboot the sever.js over and over again 
    each time when I have changed some codes, which needs me type in command to run program
    every time.
    -----solution: I add a dependency: nodemon and add scripts "devStart": "nodemon server.js",
    so that when I change some codes, I just need to save the code file then the server will reboot
    by it self.
2. Sometime when I shut down the program and want to reboot it manually, it will crash
    becasue some zombie thread still ocuppy the port.
    ------solution: I use command "lsof -i portnumber", to find out the pid of the zombie
    thread, and type in "kill pid", so that I can shut down the zombie thread.
